        "description": "WE FOUND REGINA!\n\nAfter Chad Wild Clay made \"HACKERS PARTY at Our SAFE HOUSE! Food Fight, Swimming Pool Pranks, & Dance Challenge for 24 Hours!\", Vy Qwaint created \"REGINA DEFEATS SPY NINJAS! Spending 24 Hours in Hackers Prison Least to Leave Challenge\", and Daniel Gizmo uploaded \"CAN HACKERS BE FRIENDS WITH SPY NINJAS? We Played Funny Trust Building Challenges for 24 Hours!\", Regina wore the brand new Project Zorgo hacker mask we found in the red safe and now the Cloaker has her! In order to defeat the Cloaker, the Spy Ninjas have to team up with Project Zorgo for an epic collab. Before the mission, Chad, Vy and Daniel agreed to let hackers come to the Safe House! PZ Funf, PZ409, PZ Scaredy Cat, and the Devster were so excited to finally be at the Safe House and they went crazy! Luckily, after making a mess in a food fight and diving in the swimming pool, the hackers and Spy Ninjas were able to focus on planning their mission to defeat the Cloaker. The Spy Ninjas and hackers are splitting up into three teams to stop the Cloaker's plan to hack into Nintendo Switch consoles and steal people's account information. Chad and Funf follow delivery trucks in the DeLorean to stop them from getting them to the Cloaker's lair. Vy and the Scaredy Cat hacker are stationed outside the Cloaker's lair to stop any deliveries and sneak inside if they have to. Daniel and PZ409 are hacking the Cloaker's security cameras to guide the sneaking team and stop the Cloaker. The PZ Leader said if the team can stop and catch the Cloaker, he will return Regina to the Spy Ninjas. Can the hackers and Spy Ninjas actually work together to stop the Cloaker? Will they rescue Regina from Project Zorgo?

          "title": "I JOIN HACKERS vs CLOAKER! Surprising my Best Friend Regina with a Battle Royal Rescue Challenge!",
          "description": "WE FOUND REGINA!\n\nAfter Chad Wild Clay made \"HACKERS PARTY at Our SAFE HOUSE! Food Fight, Swimming Pool Pranks, & Dance Challenge for 24 Hours!\", Vy Qwaint created \"REGINA DEFEATS SPY NINJAS! Spending 24 Hours in Hackers Prison Least to Leave Challenge\", and Daniel Gizmo uploaded \"CAN HACKERS BE FRIENDS WITH SPY NINJAS? We Played Funny Trust Building Challenges for 24 Hours!\", Regina wore the brand new Project Zorgo hacker mask we found in the red safe and now the Cloaker has her! In order to defeat the Cloaker, the Spy Ninjas have to team up with Project Zorgo for an epic collab. Before the mission, Chad, Vy and Daniel agreed to let hackers come to the Safe House! PZ Funf, PZ409, PZ Scaredy Cat, and the Devster were so excited to finally be at the Safe House and they went crazy! Luckily, after making a mess in a food fight and diving in the swimming pool, the hackers and Spy Ninjas were able to focus on planning their mission to defeat the Cloaker. The Spy Ninjas and hackers are splitting up into three teams to stop the Cloaker's plan to hack into Nintendo Switch consoles and steal people's account information. Chad and Funf follow delivery trucks in the DeLorean to stop them from getting them to the Cloaker's lair. Vy and the Scaredy Cat hacker are stationed outside the Cloaker's lair to stop any deliveries and sneak inside if they have to. Daniel and PZ409 are hacking the Cloaker's security cameras to guide the sneaking team and stop the Cloaker. The PZ Leader said if the team can stop and catch the Cloaker, he will return Regina to the Spy Ninjas. Can the hackers and Spy Ninjas actually work together to stop the Cloaker? Will they rescue Regina from Project Zorgo?
